# Web-API-Test

## Web API Test
this is a quiz with four multiple choice questions that shows if the answer is correct by highlighting the chosen answer in yellow, or stating that the chosen answer is incorrect by highlighting it red.
There is a timer that is presented as well that counts down each question.  There is also a progress bar that dictates which question you are on, as well the points that you have accumulated. There is also a highscore board that is connected to the local storage.
